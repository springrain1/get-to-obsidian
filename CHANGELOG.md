and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- 📄 **YAML Frontmatter Properties**: Converted note metadata (title, created time, and tags) into standard Obsidian YAML properties block instead of inline text.
- 📎 **Generic Attachments Support**: Added explicit Turndown rules to capture standard file attachments (like PDFs) linked via `<a>` tags and convert them to Obsidian local links.

### Changed
- 📝 **Heading Format (`ATX`)**: Updated Turndown configurations to use `atx` style for headers (`#`, `##`) instead of `setext` style (`======`).

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Mobile File Import Crash (`undefined path`)**: Added fallback handling via `FileReader` ArrayBuffer to smoothly handle `.zip` files when exact paths are hidden on Mobile/Tablet devices.
- 🐛 **Nested Bullet/Ordered Lists in Paragraphs**: Fixed an issue where GetNote nested lists (`* `, `- `, `1. `) inside `<p>` blocks were not converted to proper Markdown lists correctly. Implemented strict RegExp parsing.
- 🐛 **Sanitized Note Paths (`ENOENT`)**: Fixed sync crash preventing files taking titles with path-forbidden chars (`/`, `\`, `:`, `?`). Files are now correctly named using sanitized variables.
- 🐛 **Audio Playback Embeds**: Recovered `<audio>` attachments parsing which was skipped directly to prevent extraction failures, allowing `.mp3` etc. to natively embed with `![[ ]]`.
- 🐛 **Redundant Image Names**: Eliminated `.image-title` spans directly appended below images during HTML to Markdown extraction to remove trailing texts near images.
- 🐛 **Ghost Empty Folders in Obsidian**: Resolved issue where attaching an accidental trailing slash (`/get attachment/`) told Obsidian to generate an empty child folder in Explorer UI.
- 🐛 **Excessive Backslash Escapes**: Neutralized Turndown's overzealous backslash escapes over normal punctuation (e.g., `gk\_live\_\*`), yielding clean and readable Markdown.
