## 🎉 Version 3.1.0 Latest Update

### ✨ New Features

- **🚀 Selective Attachment Import**: Added a new UI section to choose which attachment types (Images, Audio, Video, Documents) to import, preventing unwanted clutter in the Obsidian vault
- **🔗 Source Link YAML Extraction**: Automatically extracts the "Original Source" link from notes and saves it as a clean `source` field in YAML Frontmatter for better metadata management
- **🛡️ HTML Parsing Defense (Fidelity Preservation)**: Implemented a robust traversal mechanism to prevent body content loss caused by malformed or unclosed `<p>` tags in source exports

### 🔧 Improvements

- **📊 Large File Processing Strategy**: Re-engineered ZIP handling to prioritize direct OS paths on desktop. Introduced the **Streaming Fallback** for 3GB+ files on restricted environments (Mobile/Tablet), resolving the "requested file could not be read" error
- **🧹 Refined Markdown Escaping**: Optimized the backslash cleaning regex to only target visual noise (`\_`, `\.`) while preserving critical structural markers for links, headers, and code blocks

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Content Loss in Long Notes**: Fixed a critical bug where specific HTML structures from exports triggered accidental mass deletion of note bodies during metadata extraction
- **Fenced Code Block Unmasking**: Improved HTML entity decoding within `<pre><code>` blocks to ensure symbols like `<` and `&` appear correctly in Markdown

---

## ✨ Features

### Core Features
- ✅ **Incremental Sync**: Smart detection to import only new notes, avoiding duplicates
- ✅ **Content Update Detection**: Automatically detects and re-imports edited notes
- ✅ **Selective Attachment Import**: Choose which attachment types to import (Images, Audio, Video, Documents)
- ✅ **Source Link Extraction**: Automatically extracts and saves source links to YAML frontmatter

### Visualization
- 🎨 **Moments Timeline**: Chronological view of all notes
- 🎨 **Canvas Board**: Visual network of notes (link or embed mode)

### Advanced Features
- 🔗 **Bi-directional Links** (Experimental): Preserves `[[wiki-links]]` format
- 📅 **Merge by Date**: Optional merging of same-day notes into single file
- ⚡ **Highlight Syntax**: Auto-converts `<mark>` to `==highlight==`
- 📄 **YAML Frontmatter**: Metadata stored as standard Obsidian properties
